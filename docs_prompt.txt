You are an expert technical writer and senior backend engineer. Your task is to generate complete, production-ready documentation for a Python project named **Neuro** — a "Chain-of-Thought as a Service" SaaS platform that provides APIs for reasoning, reflection, and explanation generation. The documentation will be built using **Mintlify** (https://mintlify.com/), so ensure the structure, formatting, and syntax are fully compatible with Mintlify’s framework and folder conventions.

Follow these exact instructions:

1. **Goal of the project:**
   Neuro is an API-first reasoning infrastructure that enables developers to perform multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought) through a clean, scalable backend. It provides endpoints for reasoning pipelines, monitoring, evaluation, and introspection. The goal is to make chain-of-thought available as a service — usable by other applications, research tools, or AI orchestration layers.

2. **High-level structure of the project:**
   ```
   /src
     ├── reasoning/
     │    ├── pipeline.py          # Core reasoning orchestration (ReasoningPipeline class)
     │    ├── agent.py             # Defines ReasoningAgent that generates, refines, and validates reasoning
     │    ├── utils.py             # Helper functions for text parsing, token counting, formatting
     │
     ├── api/
     │    ├── main.py              # FastAPI entrypoint exposing reasoning endpoints
     │    ├── routes/
     │    │     ├── reasoning.py   # /reason endpoint for invoking chain of thought
     │    │     ├── monitor.py     # /monitor endpoints for tracking and scoring reasoning results
     │    │     ├── eval.py        # /eval endpoints for faithfulness and safety evaluation
     │
     ├── monitor/
     │    ├── score.py             # Evaluation logic for reasoning quality
     │    ├── metrics.py           # Quantitative tracking of reasoning accuracy and safety
     │
     ├── config/
     │    ├── settings.py          # Configuration loader (API keys, model configs, etc.)
     │
     ├── tests/
     │    ├── test_reasoning.py
     │    ├── test_monitor.py
     │    ├── test_api.py
     │
     ├── __init__.py
   timestamps.txt
   README.md
   requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Features to document in depth:**
   - ReasoningPipeline: execution flow, state tracking, model interaction
   - ReasoningAgent: core chain-of-thought generator and refinement logic
   - Faithfulness and Safety Evaluation: scoring algorithms, metrics definitions
   - REST API: detailed endpoint documentation (`/reason`, `/eval`, `/monitor`)
   - Config system: environment variables, model provider integrations
   - Extensibility: how to plug in new reasoning models or evaluation modules
   - Usage examples: full examples of using the API with cURL and Python SDK
   - Deployment: how to run Neuro in production or locally
   - Internal architecture: how modules interact, data flow, and reasoning lifecycle

4. **Mintlify Documentation Requirements:**
   - Generate documentation in **Mintlify’s file structure**, including:
     ```
     /docs
       ├── introduction.md
       ├── getting-started.md
       ├── api/
       │     ├── reasoning.md
       │     ├── monitor.md
       │     ├── eval.md
       ├── internals/
       │     ├── pipeline.md
       │     ├── agent.md
       │     ├── metrics.md
       ├── config.md
       ├── contributing.md
     ```
   - Each markdown file must include:
     - A frontmatter title and description block (Mintlify style)
     - Well-structured headers (`##`, `###`)
     - Inline code examples in Python
     - Explanations for all parameters, responses, and return types
     - API examples formatted for Mintlify’s code block syntax
     - Links between related sections (`[See Reasoning Agent →](../internals/agent.md)`)

5. **Style Guide:**
   - Use a formal, instructive tone suitable for developers.
   - Keep sentences concise and technical.
   - Each page must be standalone and complete.
   - Include short example blocks for clarity.
   - Focus on both **conceptual** and **practical** understanding.

6. **Output:**
   - Generate the **entire Mintlify docs directory** as text, with file structure and contents for each `.md` file.
   - Do not include comments or explanations about your process — just produce the docs in final form.

Your output should therefore contain the full Mintlify documentation tree in markdown format for every module and functionality of the Neuro project, ready to copy into the `/docs` folder.
